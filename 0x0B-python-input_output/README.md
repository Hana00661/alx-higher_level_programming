*JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It's a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate. It's based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language syntax, but it's completely language-independent, meaning it can be used with any programming language.

Here are some key things to know about JSON:

Structure: JSON data is made up of two main structures: objects and arrays. Objects are collections of name/value pairs, where the names are strings in double quotes and the values can be strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, or other objects. Arrays are ordered lists of values, which can be any of the same types as the values in objects.
Readability: JSON is designed to be human-readable, so it's easy to understand what the data represents even if you're not familiar with the specific format. This makes it a great choice for sharing data between different systems or applications.
Language independence: As mentioned before, JSON is language-independent, so it can be used with any programming language. This makes it a very versatile format that can be used in a wide variety of applications.
Common uses: JSON is commonly used for transmitting data between web servers and web browsers, for storing data in configuration files, and for exchanging data between different applications.

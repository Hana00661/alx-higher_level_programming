*Inheritance 
	In Python is a mechanism that allows you to create new classes (called derived classes or child classes) that inherit the attributes and methods of existing classes (called base classes or parent classes). It promotes code reuse, extensibility, and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

Key Concepts:

*Base Class: The class from which other classes inherit attributes and methods. It provides a foundation for specialized classes.
Derived Class: The class that inherits from a base class, gaining its features and potentially adding or modifying its own.
*Inheritance Relationship: A "parent-child" relationship between classes, where the derived class is a specialized version of the base class.
